# Introduction

In this project, our objective is to apply model selection methods introduced in Chapter 6, Linear Model Selection and Regularization, from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Deniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. In our analysis, we compare the fit of models generated by 5 different regression methods, regression model obtained by Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Principal Components regression and Partial Least Squares regression. To evaluate how well each model fits the data, we perform 10-fold cross validation in the model construction process and select the model with minimum cross-validation errors in terms of the running parameter.
