# Conclusion

Combining the coefficients from all five regression models, we notice that only the coefficients for Limit, Rating and StudentYes vary a lot and a number of regressors have coefficients close to 0. As we explained above, each model has its own feature and can lead to the optimal regression model under different circumstances. Here, for the data set we work on in this project, both our analysis and MSE shows that Lasso Regression model fits the best, followed by OLS and PlSR, and appropriate models lead to more accurate prediction with smaller MSE.
